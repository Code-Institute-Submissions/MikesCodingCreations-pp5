We didn't pick our website colors by accident! Every shade is carefully chosen to resonate with you, our fitness-focused audience. The palette evokes a sense of health, vitality, and energy – just like the feeling you get after a great workout. But it's not all about excitement – we've also balanced it with professional and trustworthy tones to create a visually appealing and inviting atmosphere you can rely on.
- **#FEFEFE(White):** 
- **#182C2A(Neon Green):**  
- **#000(Black):** 
  
<strong>Seamless Navigation, Energised Design:</strong> This cohesive color scheme creates a visually-appealing and user-friendly interface. It will guide you effortlessly through our fitness products, empowering you to confidently take the first step towards a healthier, fitter you.

### Typography
<strong>Fonts That Fit Your Fitness Goals:</strong>
Just like our design, the fonts on the PureProteinPowders website are chosen with purpose. We use a modern, clean primary font **(we'll reveal the name soon!)** that ensures easy reading on any device, whether you're browsing on your desktop or checking us out on the go. Headings are clear and attention-grabbing, guiding you through the content effortlessly. And to make sure you never miss a call to action, buttons and important elements use slightly larger, stand-out fonts.

### Images
- **Hero image:** 
- **Logo:** Our logo starts with **Pure,** instantly conveying the power and energy you get from our products. They're designed to fuel your fitness journey and support overall well-being.  **Protein Powders** makes our focus clear – top-quality protein to help you build muscle, recover faster, and maintain a healthy lifestyle.

### Favicon
<strong>A Tiny Icon, Big Impact:</strong>  We sweat the small stuff too! Our website favicon cleverly uses three interlocking **Ps** to form a powerful symbol. It's a subtle nod to our brand name, Pure Protein Powders, instantly recognisable to those familiar with our mission.
